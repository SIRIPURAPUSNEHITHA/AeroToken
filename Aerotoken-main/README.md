🚨 Problem Statement
Traditional flight ticketing systems face several challenges, including fraud, lack of transparency, and inefficiencies in ticket management. Centralized platforms are prone to issues such as double booking, counterfeit tickets, and data breaches. Additionally, travelers often have limited control over their tickets, with restrictions on transferability and resale.

A more secure, transparent, and user-controlled solution is needed to address these issues, ensuring ticket authenticity while eliminating intermediaries.
